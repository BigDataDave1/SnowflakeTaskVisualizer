# Why I Built This
I often get asked for better ways to visualize or interact with task dependencies and hierarchies beyond show tasks.
I was on a call with one of my favorite clients from Sunnyvale last Thursday, and we chatted through methods of using Snowsight to do this.
With these SQL snippets and Snowsight charts you too should be able to better understand your tasks, their run history and dependencies.
Just in case you do not have dependant tasks yet, I have included a brief sample set of dependant tasks.
